Hello DJ, thank you for taking the time to check this out and giving me the opportunity to share my thoughts with you. I enjoyed the conversation with you last week, and I am excited to tell you more about my passion, how I found ***, and why I am interested in joining the team.

I am a senior full-stack engineer with over eight years of experience, having worked as a founding engineer for several start-ups. My core skill sets include JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, and Next.js, and infrastructure-as-a-service using AWS and Docker, database technologies MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL etc. but definitely not limited to them.  However, I am always eager to learn new technologies, especially emerging trends and innovations in the industry.

Technology has always been my passion, and I strive to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
That's why I frequently visit the public repository for Next.js on GitHub to learn about new updates, releases, and engage with other developers.

And It was during one of these visits that I discovered ***.  I stumbled upon information about the company in a forum community on the Next.js repository, and I was intrigued. So I visited the *** website to learn more, and I was particularly impressed by their focus on the UX and DX, I mean the user experience and developer experience.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
As a front-end engineer at Starstock, its an eCommerce platform in the hospitality industry, I witnessed firsthand the critical role that UX plays in the success of a project. I was a member of a small, agile team of 12 members using Scrum methodology and I was responsible for implementing the front-end using Next.js, apollo-graphql, antdesign, rebassjs for styled-components, and other technologies.

Although Starstock initially failed to meet our expected user engagement levels after launch, we conducted research and discovered that overhauling the user interface was the solution. So we hired a UX/UI designer team, made significant changes to the user interface, and achieved our desired results. This experience has shown me the importance of UX in achieving business goals.

But while UX is essential, DX is equally critical especially for a long term run, I experienced while working as a full-stack engineer at Lumina, a startup company. Lumina had excellent UX, its designer team was great, but its DX needed improvement. 
Though I can totally understnad in most of startup cmopanies, building the product and presenting it to the clients is weigh more importnat than the code quality. At least, that was what happened in some of the startup companies I worked with including Lumina. As a result, I spent a significant amount of time optimizing code quality and addressing technical debt. I used design patterns in JavaScript programming, Next.js best practices, CI/CD pipelines, and third-party services such as Sentry, Jenkins, CircleCI, and others to ensure quality assurance. As a result, we were able to scale the platform flexibly and fast for future stages with high confidence.

My experiences have reinforced my belief that a balanced approach to UX and DX is essential for the long-term success of any project. 
Though I believe I have rather enough experience in my field and its ecosystem at this point, I am sure that I should always try hard to gain knowledge in the future.
I am always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the industry best practices, and if my next company shares common ground with me about this goal, then it will become an ideal place where I can commit heavily for a long time, and I believe that *** shares this philosophy. Because its partnerships with Vercel, Next.js, Svelet and other technical teams proves it.

In addition to a shared vision, I also value a collaborative team environment, and I believe that *** excels in this regard. I am eager to learn more about the company and the team and would love to join *** eventually.

Thank you and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.
